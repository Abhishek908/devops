go to your local repo folder and then run . This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. 
This is the first step in creating a repository.  After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.
git init (this will initialize your local repo).

Add one or more files to staging:
git add <filename>
git add *

Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository)
git commit -m "Commit message"

Commit any files you've added with git add, and also commit any files you've changed since then
git commit -a

Send changes to the master branch of your remote repository
git push origin master

List the files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit
git status

Connect to a remote repository
git remote add origin <server>

List all currently configured remote repo
git remote -v

To start working in a different branch, use git checkout to switch branches.
git checkout branchname

git branch branchname
git branch -a (list)
git branch -d branchname (delete)

git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- friday1.txt  (differnce between file contents between commits.)
